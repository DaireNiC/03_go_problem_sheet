//Go exercise 2 : Adapt the ElizaResponse function to, if the input does not contain the word "father",
//check the input begins with "I am ". If it does, use a regular expression to capture the rest of the user input.
//Return the string "How do you know you are _?", replacing the underscore with the captured part of the input.
//Add, along with the five previous test inputs, the following test inputs.
